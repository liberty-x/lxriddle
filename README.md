# LX Riddle
The search for a riddle-based forum is over!!! :+1::+1:

## Who?

The same team who brought you such hits as LX News :newspaper: and LX Search :mag: - Liberty-X, a team in the 6th iteration of the Founders & Coders academy. Members are: Justen Barget, Rachel Black, Huw Davies and Ruth Uwemedimo.

## What?

LX Riddle will be a forum where you can share and answer riddles, and even chat about them with your pals / complete strangers! We are hosting this on Heroku and using Redis as a database. Socket.io will also be used for an embedded chat room. We are conducting this project during our 5th week of the course.

## Why?

We are reinforcing our knowledge of Redis, as well as integrating more functionality using the DB - such as upvoting, deleting etc. We have also not implemented socket.io before, so we hope to do this successfully here. Once this is achieved, we are looking to implement some authentication for our users :closed_lock_with_key:
